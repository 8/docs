Lambda Factory is a consulting company specializing in designing and building complex systems using Functional Programming languages such as F#, Elm and Elixir. It also offers help with introducing functional programming and open source driven development to the organization, as well as trainings, workshops and mentoring. Founded by open source contributor and well-known member of F# Community, Lambda Factory has been committed to supporting F# Community and helping it grow.

### The F# Community
The SAFE stack was written largely by the community as open source projects, such as Saturn, Giraffe, Fable and Elmish (as well as the alternative elements within the stack). All those teams are always happy to contribute and help out.

### Social
You can also reach out to the SAFE team on @safe_stack or on the regular F# channels on Slack: either the official F# Foundation or on the Functional Programming Slack. We'll be expanding this over time.
