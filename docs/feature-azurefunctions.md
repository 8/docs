## Going serverless with SAFE

With SAFE-Stack you can easily take advantage of serverless computing via [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/).

With Functions-As-A-Service (FAAS) you can focus on building your business logic and don't need to worry about provisioning and maintaining servers (hence "serverless"). Azure Functions provides a managed compute platform with high reliability. If you use a "consumption plan" it scales on demand and you only get billed for the actual runtime of your code.
