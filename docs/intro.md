# Introduction

## What is SAFE?
The SAFE stack is a flexible end-to-end, functional-first stack for cloud-ready web development that emphasizes type-safe programming. The SAFE stack allows you to develop client/server web applications almost *entirely* in F#, without needing to compromise and shoehorn your codebase into an object-oriented framework or library, or needing to be an expert in CSS or HTML.

## What are the SAFE components?
The SAFE stack is comprised of four main components:

### Saturn
The Saturn framework builds on top of Giraffe, which itself models itself on the Suave programming model. Saturn (and Giraffe) provides a flexible web programming framework built on top of ASP .NET Core - a high performance, rock-solid web server. Saturn and Giraffe can host RESTful API endpoints, or drive static websites, or server-generated content, all inside an easy-to-learn functional programming model.
### Azure
### Fable
### Elmish
