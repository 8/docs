# Introduction

## What is SAFE?
The SAFE stack is a flexible end-to-end, functional-first stack for cloud-ready web development that emphasizes type-safe programming.

The SAFE stack allows you to develop client/server web applications almost *entirely* in [F#](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/languages/fsharp/), without needing to compromise and shoehorn your codebase into an object-oriented framework or library, and without needing you to be an expert in CSS or HTML to create compelling, rich client-side web applications.

The SAFE stack is made up of four components:

* A **web server** running on .NET Core for hosting back-end services in F#
* A **hosting platform** that provides simple, scalable deployment models plus associated platform services for application developers
* A mechanism to run F# in the web browser for **client-side delivery of F#**
* An F# programming model for **client-side user interfaces**
