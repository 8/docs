# SAFE Stack overview
The SAFE acronym is made up of four separate components:

* **S**aturn for back-end services in F#
* **A**zure as a hosting platform plus associated platform services
* **F**able for running F# in the web browser
* **E**lmish for client-side user interfaces

## F# on the Server

### Saturn + Giraffe
The Saturn framework builds on top of Giraffe, which itself models itself on the Suave programming model. Saturn (and Giraffe) provides a flexible web programming framework built on top of ASP .NET Core - a high performance, rock-solid web server. Saturn and Giraffe can host RESTful API endpoints, or drive static websites, or server-generated content, all inside an easy-to-learn functional programming model.
