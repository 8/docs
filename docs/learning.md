This section contains useful repositories that allow you to learn more about the SAFE stack, at your own pace.

## SAFE Dojo
The [SAFE Dojo](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/SAFE-Dojo/) is a guided set of tasks designed to give you hands-on experience with the client and server components of the SAFE stack. You'll create server-side routes, client side UI and shared validation logic as you create a mashup application to provide details on UK locations.

The dojo takes around 90 minutes to complete if you have never worked with the stack before.

## Example repositories
The following example repositories (and more!) can be found in the official [SAFE Stack](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack) organisational GitHub page.

### SAFE Bookstore
The [SAFE Bookstore](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/SAFE-BookStore) demonstrates many of the useful features of a larger SAFE application, including login authentication using JWT tokens, automated deployment via Docker and SEO support with urls for pages. It also includes an example of using Azure Storage tables as a persistence store.

### SAFE ConfPlanner
The [SAFE ConfPlanner](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/SAFE-ConfPlanner) demonstrates how to build and share a complex domain model in SAFE across client and server, along with the use of websockets for a "reactive" UI support push notifications. It also demonstrates the use of F#'s flexible mailbox processors to implement an event-driven architecture.

### SAFE Search
The [SAFE Search](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/SAFE-Search) repository shows how to use Azure services to implement a SAFE application that supports searching over multiple data sources with support for find-ahead typing and throttling. The application uses a combination of Azure Search and Azure Storage Tables to construct a large search index that can rapidly find results in a number of ways.

### SAFE Chat
The [SAFE Chat](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/SAFE-Chat) application is a real-time chat application built on SAFE that uses the [AKKA framework](https://getakka.net/) to manage actors that represent chat users, including Akka Streams and the Akkling F# library.

### Mobile SAFE
The [SAFE Nightwatch](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/SAFE-Nightwatch) app is a sample mobile application using the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) library, built on top of the SAFE stack. React Native permits a very similar programming when writing SAFE applications as browser applications, so the experience should be very familiar to you.
