> SAFE gives us a fast development cycle for our web and mobile platforms

We at [msu solutions GmbH](https://msu-solutions.de/) are big fans of SAFE stack. For the last couple of years we were already using F# open source technologies for web and mobile projects. Tools like the Fable compiler and elmish are rock solid and a pleasure to work with.

Since the release of SAFE, we see that all these important technologies are now bundled and tested under one big umbrella. 
Especially the commercial support for SAFE is very important for us and our customers.
