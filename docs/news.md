Due to the unclear future regarding the licensing of Suave and its dependencies, the SAFE team have today made the unamimous decision to **remove Suave as a recommended option on the SAFE stack**. We will no longer provide guidance on integrating Suave with the SAFE stack, nor will we maintain existing capabilities for it in SAFE tooling.

**Our default recommendation for SAFE stack applications is to use Saturn or Giraffe directly, running on top of Kestel on ASP .NET.**

SAFE will continue to promote all libraries, frameworks and toolchains that provide clear and consistent licensing, do not aim to discriminate against specific libraries on a commercial basis and promote open discussion.
