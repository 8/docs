# Elmish
Elm-like abstractions for F# applications targeting Fable.  

Elmish implements core abstractions that can be used to build applications following the [model-view-update](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/02-elm-arch/cover.html) Architecture made famous by Elm. 

The Elmish library however does not model any "view" and is intended for use in conjuction with a DOM/renderer, like React/ReactNative or VirtualDOM.
